## Workflow Assumptions
1. Every user accessing the system is assumed to be a registered customer and are able to book for a covid test in the application so there is no sign up feature
2. Every user is meant to be a customer, so all of them could place a booking for on site or home testing as long as he or she is a registered user on the system. 
3. Administerer is not assigned to an on site booking when the user makes a booking. The administerer will only be assigned to the on site test booking when an interview has been conducted by the administerer to the patient.
4. Administerer is assigned to the home booking when the user makes a booking.
5. RAT tests provide on-site or home supervised testing while PCR tests only provide on-site tests.

### New Assumptions
6. Editing, Reverting, Cancelling, Deleting and Processing (Interview) a booking is only applied to bookings made for On-Site Testing.
7. Latest User Privileges for OnSite Booking

    ###### a. Resident         - Create, View, Edit, Revert, Cancel Booking [ONLY FOR THE BOOKINGS THAT THEY MADE]
    ###### b. Receptionist     - Create, View (via admin panel), Delete, Edit, Revert, Cancel Booking [FOR ANY BOOKING]
    ###### c. HealthcareWorker - Create, Edit, Revert, Cancel Booking [ONLY FOR THE BOOKINGS THAT THEY MADE]; View, Process (Interview) Booking [FOR ANY BOOKING]
8. Latest User Privileges for Home Booking

    ###### a. Resident         - Create, View Booking [ONLY FOR THE BOOKINGS THAT THEY MADE]
    ###### b. Receptionist     - Create, View Booking; Update whether a user has picked up RAT test kit for home testing if the user indicates that he will pick up test kit at the testing site
    ###### c. HealthcareWorker - Create, View Booking
9. Notification system is only applied to changes made to bookings for On-Site Testing and only the receptionist at the relevant testing site will receive.
10. View the latest notifications in the Notifications Page whereby the latest one will be shown at the top


## User Guidelines
1. *** Important *** Please create a java class file - "APIKey.java" and put under "./assignment3/src/main/java/fit3077/lab02team14/assignment2/constants/", then create a class level variable in the class by placing this line "public static final String MYAPIKEY = "<Your_API_Key>";" into the file. Replace <Your_API_Key> with your actual API key.
2. To check which localhost does this application run on, please refer to "./assignment3/src/main/resources/application.properties" to check for the line server.port=8080. If it is 8080, means that after running the application, you shall open the browser and type "localhost:8080" into the address bar for testing out the application.
3. The root folder of the application should always be the "/assignment3" folder to allow the saving of QR Code to work as intended.
4. The directory which the QR Code generated from booking a home testing is always saved to "assignment3/src/main/resources/static/image/qrCodes/". 
5. QR code will be generated every time when the user views a home testing as the qrCode is retrieved from backend database.
6. The uplaod directory for a Receptionist / Healthcare administerer to search for a home testing should always be in "assignment3/src/main/resources/static/image/qrCodes/", which is the same as the saved directory.
7. If user wishes to test for invalid qRCode, makes sure that the image is uploaded from the directory "assignment3/src/main/resources/static/image/qrCodes/".
8. This application's default server port is set to 8080. To change it, go to the application.properties file in our resources file and change the server port to your desired port.
9. Please do not refresh the webpage after login during the testing process as page refresh might wipe out the data stored temporarily in the http session. 
10. Revert button will only be displayed to the user if edit is made to the booking.
11. Multithreaded programming is not implemented in the assignment - Therefore, in order to test out the notification system that all the receptionists in the same testing site could receive the same notification.

    ###### a. Please make some changes to the booking [Create, View, Delete, Edit, Revert, Cancel, Process (Interview)] as a receptionistA.1 working in testingSiteA.
    ###### b. Then check under the notification page to check if you receive the notification.
    ###### c. Then, logout and login as another receptionistA.2 who is also working in testingSite A, repeat step b.
    ###### d. If the changes made to the booking (Edit / Revert) involve 2 testing sites, all the receptionists in the relevant testing site will receive the notification. Repeat step a to c as a receptionistA working in testingSiteA and receptionistB for verification working in testingSiteB.
